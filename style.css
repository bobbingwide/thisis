/**
The starting point for this theme is that it doesn't contain any CSS at all
The idea is that the styling is provided using the global styles solution
which is implemented in experimental-theme.json

Since this file doesn't actually contain any CSS then there's no need to enqueue it in functions.php
We can probably even get away with not having a functions.php file.
